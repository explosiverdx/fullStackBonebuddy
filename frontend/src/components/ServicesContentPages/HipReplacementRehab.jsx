              <p><strong>Hip Replacement Recovery</strong> is a journey — from the first careful step after surgery to the day you walk, climb stairs, and return to your everyday life without fear. At <strong>BoneBuddy</strong> we guide you through this journey with a structured, evidence-based plan that combines hands-on physiotherapy, home-based exercises and powerful digital tracking so both patients and doctors stay informed at every step.</p>

              <h2 className="wrist-h2">Why <strong>Hip Surgery Rehabilitation</strong> Matters</h2>
              <p>Undergoing a hip replacement or a hip operation is the start of a life-changing recovery. Without the right rehabilitation, patients can face stiffness, muscle weakness and prolonged pain. Our <strong>hip surgery rehabilitation</strong> programme focuses on early mobilization, progressive strengthening and balance retraining to restore function, reduce complications like DVT, and make your new hip last longer.</p>
