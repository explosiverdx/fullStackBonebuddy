                <p>Recovering from spinal surgery can be one of the most crucial phases in your health journey. The spine is the backbone of your body — literally and functionally. After spine surgery, proper rehabilitation is what decides whether you regain full mobility or continue struggling with pain and stiffness. That's where <strong>BoneBuddy's Spinal Surgery Rehab</strong> steps in — India's first <strong>digital physiotherapy program</strong> designed for safe, structured, and surgeon-supervised <strong>spine surgery recovery</strong>.</p>

                <h2 className="wrist-h2">What Is Spinal Surgery Rehab?</h2>
                <p><strong>Spinal Surgery Rehab</strong> is a guided recovery program focused on helping patients regain mobility, strength, and confidence after <strong>backbone surgery</strong> or other <strong>spine procedures</strong>. Many patients believe that surgery alone is enough — but in reality, <strong>the real healing begins after surgery</strong>.</p>
                <p className="mt-3">Through <strong>BoneBuddy</strong>, patients receive a personalized plan crafted by certified physiotherapists in collaboration with <strong>orthopaedic surgeons, spine specialists, and neurosurgeons</strong>. Our goal is to ensure that every patient heals efficiently, avoids complications, and rebuilds strength safely — right from home.</p>

                <p className="mt-3">Without a structured rehabilitation plan, patients risk delayed healing or recurring spine problems.
