                <p><strong>Ankle surgery rehabilitation</strong> is one of the most crucial steps in restoring normal mobility, strength, and confidence after surgery. Whether it's due to a <strong>broken ankle</strong>, <strong>ligament damage</strong>, or <strong>ankle discomfort</strong>, proper rehabilitation ensures you recover fully and prevent future injuries. BoneBuddy brings India's first digital physiotherapy platform that helps patients heal better—right from the comfort of home, under expert guidance.</p>

                <h2 className="wrist-h2">Understanding Ankle Surgery Recovery</h2>
                <p>Ankle surgery is often performed to repair <strong>damaged ankle ligaments</strong>, fix a <strong>broken ankle bone</strong>, or correct instability after an injury. Post-surgery, patients commonly experience <strong>ankle soreness</strong>, stiffness, and difficulty bearing weight. The <strong>ankle ligament rupture recovery time</strong> or <strong>damaged ankle ligaments recovery time</strong> varies depending on the severity of injury, but without guided rehabilitation, recovery can be slow and incomplete.</p>
                <p className="mt-3">That's where a structured <strong>ankle surgery recovery</strong> program becomes essential. BoneBuddy's physiotherapists create evidence-based recovery protocols focused on restoring motion, strength, and balance—so you can get back to your active lifestyle faster and safer.</p>

                <h2 className="wrist-h2">Why Ankle Rehabilitation Matters</h2>
                <p>After ankle surgery, immobilization and swelling can lead to stiffness and muscle weakness. Starting guided physiotherapy early not only helps control swelling and pain but also accelerates tissue healing and improves joint function. Without a proper plan, many patients face prolonged <strong>ankle discomfort</strong> or repeated injuries due to weak <strong>ankle joints</strong>.</p>
                <p className="mt-3">BoneBuddy ensures every patient receives personalized, phase-wise recovery through our digital rehabilitation platform—bridging the gap between surgeons, physiotherapists, and patients through continuous monitoring and real-time progress tracking.</p>
