              <p>A new knee should mean a new life — less pain, more mobility, and the freedom to walk, climb stairs and return to daily activities. But the road from the operating table to independent movement is a journey. <strong>Post knee replacement physiotherapy</strong> is the bridge that changes surgical success into real, everyday recovery. At BoneBuddy, we combine evidence-based therapy, doctor supervision and digital tracking to make your <strong>recovery from knee replacement surgery</strong> faster, safer and measurable.</p>

              <h2 className="wrist-h2">Why Knee Replacement Recovery Matters</h2>
              <p>Undergoing a <strong>knee replacement surgery</strong> — whether a <em>total knee replacement</em> or <em>complete knee replacement</em> — is a major step. The operation fixes the joint, but the body still needs guided rehabilitation to recover range of motion, rebuild muscle strength and prevent complications like stiffness or gait abnormalities. Without structured physiotherapy, patients often face slow improvement, reduced function and frustration.</p>
              <p>BoneBuddy's approach ensures you don't have to choose between convenience and quality. Our structured, surgeon-supervised plans are tailored to your recovery timeline and delivered at home — perfect for elderly patients who find travelling difficult, working professionals who need flexible timings, and anyone wanting insurance-supported, trackable care.</p>

              <h2 className="wrist-h2">Common Questions about Recovery Time for Knee Replacement</h2>
              <p>Every patient's recovery timeline is different, but typical milestones include: walking with aids in days, independent walking in weeks, and return to low-impact activities within 8-12 weeks for many patients. Full recovery and high-demand activities may take 6-12 months depending on age, preoperative fitness and surgical factors.</p>
              <p>Our <strong>knee replacement recovery timeline</strong> within the 25-session plan focuses on early safe gains and gradual progression so you build lasting strength and confidence. We coordinate closely with surgeons to adjust therapy if needed.</p>
