              <p>A wrist injury can change how you live every day — from lifting a cup of tea to typing on your laptop. After wrist surgery, recovery can feel confusing and slow. That’s where <strong>BoneBuddy’s Wrist Surgery Rehab</strong> comes in — a structured, doctor-supervised recovery program that combines advanced physiotherapy, personalized care plans, and digital tracking for complete recovery and confidence.</p>

              <h2 className="wrist-h2">Understanding Wrist Surgery Recovery</h2>
              <p>Whether you've undergone a <strong>wrist fracture surgery</strong>, <strong>scaphoid fracture operation</strong>, <strong>wrist fusion</strong>, or even <strong>broken wrist surgery</strong>, proper rehabilitation is essential to restore movement, strength, and flexibility. Many patients assume recovery ends once the stitches are removed, but the real healing begins after surgery — through guided exercises and professional monitoring.</p>
              <p>At BoneBuddy, our physiotherapists design wrist-specific rehabilitation plans based on your surgery type, healing stage, and comfort. Our <strong>25-session physiotherapy plan after wrist surgery</strong> ensures every patient regains confidence, motion, and independence safely.</p>

              <h2 className="wrist-h2">Why Wrist Surgery Rehab Matters</h2>
              <p>After a <strong>wrist operation</strong> or <strong>wrist plate surgery</strong>, stiffness, pain, and weakness are common. Without guided physiotherapy, it can lead to poor movement, delayed bone healing, or even long-term discomfort.</p>
              <p><strong>BoneBuddy</strong> bridges this gap through:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Personalized exercise routines</li>
                <li>Continuous doctor-physiotherapist collaboration</li>
                <li>Smart progress tracking via the BoneBuddy app</li>
                <li>Evidence-based rehabilitation programs</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Our platform ensures every patient gets hospital-level care at home, without missing any recovery milestones.</p>
